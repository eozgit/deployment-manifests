# --- Minimal .gitignore for Deployment Configuration Repos ---

# 1. Operating System artifacts

.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# 2. Logs and temporary files

*.log
*.tmp

# 3. Development / IDE files

.idea/
.vscode/

# 4. Docker-specific (if running local tests outside of docker-compose)

# Note: Docker Compose volumes and build cache are typically handled outside the repo.
